# Object-Oriented-Programming
## Assignment 1 & Activity 2: OOP Design and Polymorphism in Python

### Assignment 1: Design Your Own Class! üèóÔ∏è

This assignment demonstrates designing a class of your choice with attributes and methods, utilizing constructors for initialization, and exploring inheritance and polymorphism through method overriding.

#### Summary

- Created a **Book** class with attributes like title, author, pages, and genre.

- Added methods to simulate reading the book and retrieving book information.

- Created a subclass **PrintedBook** that inherits from `Book`.

- The `PrintedBook` class adds extra attributes such as cover type and weight.

- Polymorphism demonstrated by overriding the `book_info()` method in the subclass.

- Added a specific method `carry()` to illustrate subclass-specific behavior.

- Constructor chaining used to initialize both base and derived class attributes.
